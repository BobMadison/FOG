            At home you have unlimited time. This is truly an almighty mountain. We'll play with clouds today. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Now it's beginning to
            make a little sense.</p>

        <p>It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Get tough with it, get strong. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here.</p>

        <p>Don't fiddle with it all day. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. Very easy to work these to death. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.</p>

        <p>If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Everybody needs a friend. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. It's hard to see things when you're too close.
            Take a step back and look. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.
